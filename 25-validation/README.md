# Validations
### Learning Goals

- Explain the advantage of fat models and skinny controllers
- Use ActiveRecord validation helpers to validate data
- Check for resource validity in the controller
- Display error messages in the view

## Validation vs Authentication vs Authorization
* Validation
    * is the data good?
        * Is that string greater than 5 characters?
        * Is that number greater than 0?
* Authentication
    * Are you who you say you are?
        * Username
        * Password
* Authorization
    * Do you have the right to do what you asked?
